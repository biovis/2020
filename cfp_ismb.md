## Call for Participation: BioVis@ISMB/ECCB 2019
**Community of Special Interest (COSI) event at [ISMB/ECCB 2019](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019)**  
**July 22, 2019**  
**Basel, Switzerland**


## Aims and Scope

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group organizes the interdisciplinary event BioVis, covering all aspects of visualization in biology. This symposium brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research.

We invite submissions of original research articles as well as poster submissions.

## Symposium Format

The symposium will be a one-day single-track event at [ISMB/ECCB](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019). It will feature keynotes and invited talks, paper sessions, highlight talks, and posters/demos. Primers will also be given to introduce key topics in visualization research. . 

## Topics

We invite contributions on all aspects of data visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics for paper and poster submissions include, but are not limited to:

 * Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
 * Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
 * Phylogenetic data
 * Biological networks and pathways
 * Biological ontologies
 * Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
 * Biological image data, such as microscopy data
 * Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
 * Modeling and simulation of biological systems
 * Neurobiology and developmental biology
 * Systems and software frameworks
 * Biological workflows or collaborative processes
 * Usability of visualization by biologists
 * Biological atlases and metadata
 * Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.

## Submission Types and Criteria

There are several ways participants can contribute to the BioVis program:

### 1. ISMB/ECCB Proceedings - *Submission Deadline: January 28, 2019*

Novel, unpublished work can be submitted as a paper to the ISMB/ECCB Proceedings. If accepted, manuscripts will be published in the OUP Journal Bioinformatics. Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their work at the symposium in a talk. Authors of rejected papers will be invited to submit a poster. 

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a full paper by January 28, 2019 at the [BioVis submission site](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019-submit/proceedings), and must adhere to the submission guidelines outlined on that site.

**IMPORTANT: During submission please select the general subject of your submissions (the “AREA”), and then make sure to specify BioVis as the “TOPIC” of your submission to ensure your manuscript is assigned to our COSI.**

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance paper submissions, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. However, please note that OUP does not support videos as supplementary materials, so you will have to host the video elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).



### 2. Talks - *Submission Deadline: April 11, 2019*

Participants are encouraged to submit short abstracts describing their recently published work related to biological data visualization or extended abstracts concerning unpublished work.  Submissions will be reviewed by the chairs and by external reviewers. If accepted, participants are required to present their work in a talk at the symposium. Authors of rejected talks will be invited to submit a poster.

#### Submission Guidelines

Published work: Authors are required to submit a short abstract (250 words) by April 11, 2019. Summaries should include a concise description of the work and may include descriptive figures. The previously published paper **must** be submitted along with the summary, unless the paper is open access.

Unpublished work: Authors are required to submit an extended abstract (1500 words) by April 11, 2019. The text should include a concise description of the work and have descriptive figures. 

### 3. Posters and demos - *Submission Deadline: {{ site.ismb_poster_submission_deadline }}*

We invite participants to submit work in progress and preliminary results, previously published work from other venues, or visualization challenges to be presented as a poster and/or interactive demo. A selection of these will be invited to give a short talk during the conference.

#### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a short abstract (250 words) and a supporting figure by {{ site.ismb_poster_submission_deadline }}. Abstracts should include a concise description of an idea, work in progress, preliminary results, visualization challenges, or previously published work presented at other venues that is also relevant for the BioVis community. If the submission is based on previous work, the published paper **must** be submitted along with the summary, unless the paper is open access.

Poster preparation instructions will be e-mailed to authors of accepted submissions.
